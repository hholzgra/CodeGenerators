milestone 1.1
-------------

- fix OS deps entries in package.xml (done)

- add support for pear channels (done)

- implement pass-by-reference for array and mixed parameters (almost done)

- allow addition of files to directories (eg. test) (done)

- static methods (done)

- conditional compilation control (done)
  
- PHP version check in config.m4 (done)

- pkg-config support (almost done)

- have functions using a conditional element in their proto
  modify their ifCondition automaticly (done)
 
- dto. for tests

- return by reference for 5.1 and above

- finish config.w32 generation (almost done, need someone 
  with windows build experience to finish and test this)

- re2c and lemon support in config.m4 / Makefile.frag generation?

- headers and libs within <with> are not taken into account in the
  documentation

- make standalone docs Makefile more clever

- check #line numbers in generated source with libxml
  -> error messages with meaningfull line numbers need this
  (pretty ok by now but not perfect)

  

not necessarily 1.1
-------------------

- find a better/portable way to do type checks for resources

- implement pass-by-reference for all parameter types

- setter/getter code for properties

- package2.xml <installdeps> (?)

- add more tests

- allow "src='path/to/file'" in more cases           
  make sure it generates #line, too

- add configure test code within DATA section of <lib> and <header> tags?
  e.g. for version checking?

  => wouldn't work this way due to config.m4/.w32 differences
     define attributes that call a single m4/w32 function instead
     which needs to be defined in seperate config snippets?

- full support for stream wrappers and filters   -> started

- full support for session handler API -> started

- full support for SAPI 

- have different levels of comment (and code?) generation
  similar to --no-help in ext_skel

- create seperate target dir for copied spec files

  - extended Makefile rules to regenerate stuff from embedded XML specs

- allow specification of file role instead of guessing by extension?

- support compiler/linker flags setting using config programs
  similar to  pkg-config: mysql_config, apxs etc.

- <lib> shared=no 
  -> drop EXTNAME_SHARED_LIBADD parameter to PHP_ADD_LIBRARY_WITH_PATH
	=> requires further research, doesn't work this way
	==> how to add *static* libraries? 

- improve $dirpath handling (?)
