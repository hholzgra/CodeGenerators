PECL_Gen - a PHP extension code generator

PECL_Gen (formerly known as ext_skel_ng) is a pure PHP replacement 
for the ext_skel shell script that comes with the PHP 4 source. 

It reads in configuration options, function prototypes and code fragments
from an XML description file and generates a complete ready-to-compile
PECL extension.

For full documentation see the manual.html file included in this package.
