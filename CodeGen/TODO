- change XML parsing to simplexml? or DOM? and delegate tag level parsing to sub-parsers?

- XSchema or RELAX/NG instead of DTD?

- more licenses
  - GPL (with exception to allow linking against PHP)
  - QPL

  - change <license> tag to either take a known license name 
    in the 'name' attribute or a free form license text as
    CDATA
